He received the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1985 for \"\"The Good War\"\", and is best remembered for his oral histories of common Americans, and for hosting a long-running radio show in Chicago.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abStuds Terkel Radio Archive | The Studs Terkel Radio Archive is an archive of over 1,000 digitized audio tapes originally aired over 45 years on Studs Terkel\\'s radio show on WFMT-FM or used in his oral history collections in the books \"Division Street America\" (1967) and \"Working\" (1974). Terkel donated a total of 5,600 tapes to the Chicago History Museum, which contracted the WFMT Radio network (formerly part of WFMT-FM), to publish the recordings online. The bulk of the tapes are not yet digitized, but the archive plans to digitize and distribute as many as possible online. The American public radio network NPR is featuring many of the tapes during the week of September 25 - October 2, 2016. The Chicago History Museum is also working with the Library of Congress to make the tapes available online and to visitors to their buildings in Washington, DC.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abThe Good War | \"The Good War\": An Oral History of World War II (1984) is a telling of the oral history of World War II written by Studs Terkel.

Set in the early 1960s among the Irish Catholic community in a small Yorkshire town, the book is about a 30-year-old mummy\\'s boy and his attempts at liberating himself from his domineering mother. The title refers to the latter\\'s wish that her \"favourite\" son, although already rather old for following his alleged vocation, become a clergyman. It was said that it was John Braine\\'s personal favourite novel of all those that he wrote and was finally filmed in 2005.\u00bb\\n[6] \u00abRoom at the Top (novel) | Room at the Top is a novel by John Braine, first published in the United Kingdom by Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1957, about the rise of an ambitious young man of humble origin, and the socio-economic struggles undergone in realising his social ambitions in post-war Britain. A film adaptation was made in 1959, followed in 2012 by a TV film. John Minton\\'s cover art from the first edition was restored and used on the new edition by Valancourt Books in 2013.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: Which author is English: John Braine or Studs Terkel?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine which author is English. We know that John Braine is an English novelist, so we can start by looking for information about his nationality. According to the text, John Braine is English. On the other hand, Studs Terkel is an American author, historian, actor, and broadcaster, so he is not English. Therefore, the answer is John Braine.\\n\\nAnswer: John Braine\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] \u00abMoran River | The Moran River is a 2.2 mi river on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States.
