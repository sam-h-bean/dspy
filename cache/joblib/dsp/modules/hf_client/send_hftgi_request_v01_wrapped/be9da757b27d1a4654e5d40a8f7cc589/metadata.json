Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison\\'s Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world\\'s oldest political party.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abDemocratic Party (South Korea, 2008) | The Democratic Party (Hangul: \ubbfc\uc8fc\ub2f9 hanja: \u6c11\u4e3b\u9ee8 ) was a liberal political party in South Korea. Since its foundation in 2008, it was the main opposition party in the 18th Assembly. In late 2011, it merged into the Democratic United Party.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abDemocrat Party (Turkey, current) | The Democratic Party (Turkish: \"Demokrat Parti\" ), abbreviated to DP, is a centre-right, conservative Turkish political party, established by S\u00fcleyman Demirel in 1983 as the True Path Party (Turkish: \"Do\u011fru Yol Partisi\" or DYP). It succeeded the historical Democratic Party and the Justice Party, two parties with similar ideologies.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abNew Democratic Party leadership election, 1971 | The 1971 New Democratic Party leadership election was a leadership convention held in Ottawa from April 21 to 24 to elect a leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada. Tommy Douglas retired as federal leader, and David Lewis was elected as his successor. At this convention the Waffle faction was at the zenith of its popularity and power. Donald C. MacDonald, the former Ontario NDP leader, was elected as the party\\'s president. The major non-leadership issue was what stance would the party take in terms of Quebec sovereignty and whether policy initiatives calling for the nationalization of the oil, gas and mining industries would pass.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abDemocratic Party (Turkey, 1970) | Democratic Party (Turkish: \"Demokratik Parti\", DP for short) was a former political party in Turkey founded on 18 December 1970 . It should not be confused with the historical Democrat Party or the current Democrat Party in Turkey.\u00bb\\n[6] \u00abDemocratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago) | The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) was the main opposition party in Trinidad and Tobago between 1957 and 1971. The party was the party which opposed the People\\'s National Movement (PNM) at the time of Independence. After several splits brought about by leadership struggles, the party lost its hold on the Indo-Trinidadian community in the 1976 General Elections and was displaced in parliament by the United Labour Front under the leadership of Basdeo Panday. The party was the representative of the ethnic Indian community in the country; however Indian Muslims were said to be less loyal to the party than Indian Hindus.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: What year was the party of the winner of the 1971 San Francisco mayoral election founded?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to answer this question. We know that the Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, and it was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson. However, the question is asking about the year the party of the winner of the 1971 San Francisco mayoral election was founded. Therefore, we need to look for the information about the winner of the 1971 San Francisco mayoral election. After researching, we found that the winner of the 1971 San Francisco mayoral election was Joseph Alioto, and his party was the Democratic Party. Therefore, the answer is 1828.\\n\\nAnswer:', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 75, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ['\\n', '\\n\\n']}}}"}, "time": 1697828132.645778}
