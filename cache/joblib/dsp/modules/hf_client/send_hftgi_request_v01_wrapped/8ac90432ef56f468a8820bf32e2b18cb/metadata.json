It was released on January 1, 2007 as the album\\'s second single through the band\\'s record label Wind-up Records. \"Lithium\" was written by the band\\'s lead singer Amy Lee and produced by music producer Dave Fortman. Initially written on the guitar when Lee was 16-years old, the song was rearranged with a complete band performance and a piano introduction. The song is a midtempo power ballad which lyrically discusses the uncertainty of the protagonist in choosing between feelings of sorrow and happiness; Lee was inspired by the drug lithium and the feeling of numbness it induces. The song was noted for its resemblance to the band\\'s previously recorded material for their debut studio album \"Fallen\" (2003), particularly to \"My Immortal\".\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abLithium (Nirvana song) | \"Lithium\" is a song by American rock band Nirvana.

It was released on September 25, 2006, through Wind-up Records. The initial date for the record to be made available for purchase was in March 2006, but was changed as a result of guitarist Terry Balsamo\\'s stroke, the loss of the band\\'s former manager, and Will Boyd\\'s and Ben Moody\\'s departure from the group. The record symbolizes a new beginning for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including gothic rock, symphonic rock and pop music as well as the use of choirs on several songs.
