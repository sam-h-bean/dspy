Tommy Douglas retired as federal leader, and David Lewis was elected as his successor. At this convention the Waffle faction was at the zenith of its popularity and power. Donald C. MacDonald, the former Ontario NDP leader, was elected as the party\\'s president. The major non-leadership issue was what stance would the party take in terms of Quebec sovereignty and whether policy initiatives calling for the nationalization of the oil, gas and mining industries would pass.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abDemocratic Party (Turkey, 1970) | Democratic Party (Turkish: \"Demokratik Parti\", DP for short) was a former political party in Turkey founded on 18 December 1970 .

After several splits brought about by leadership struggles, the party lost its hold on the Indo-Trinidadian community in the 1976 General Elections and was displaced in parliament by the United Labour Front under the leadership of Basdeo Panday. The party was the representative of the ethnic Indian community in the country; however Indian Muslims were said to be less loyal to the party than Indian Hindus.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00ab1970 (disambiguation) | 1970 was a year of the Gregorian calendar.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00ab1970 in Thailand | The year 1970 was the 188th year of the Rattanakosin Kingdom of Thailand.

We know that the party of the winner of the 1971 San Francisco mayoral election was the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party was founded in 1824, but that is not the correct answer to the question. We need to look at the context of the question, which is the year 1971. In 1971, the Democratic Party was already established and had been the party of the winner of the previous mayoral election in San Francisco. Therefore, the correct answer is 1971.\\n\\nAnswer:', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 75, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ['\\n', '\\n\\n']}}}"}, "time": 1697828130.1238947}
