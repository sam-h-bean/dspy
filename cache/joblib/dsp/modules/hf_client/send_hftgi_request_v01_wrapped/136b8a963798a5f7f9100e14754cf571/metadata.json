However, we can use the information that the town has a port on the Julianakanaal (Juliana canal) to help us find the answer. The Julianakanaal is a canal that runs through the Netherlands, so it\\'s possible that the town of Born is located on the river that the canal connects to.\\n\\nSearch Query:', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 75, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ['\\n', '\\n\\n']}}}"}, "time": 1697828129.692897}
