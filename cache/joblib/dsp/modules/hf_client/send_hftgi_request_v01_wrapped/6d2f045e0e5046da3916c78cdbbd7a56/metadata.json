He received the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1985 for \"\"The Good War\"\", and is best remembered for his oral histories of common Americans, and for hosting a long-running radio show in Chicago.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abStuds Terkel Radio Archive | The Studs Terkel Radio Archive is an archive of over 1,000 digitized audio tapes originally aired over 45 years on Studs Terkel\\'s radio show on WFMT-FM or used in his oral history collections in the books \"Division Street America\" (1967) and \"Working\" (1974). Terkel donated a total of 5,600 tapes to the Chicago History Museum, which contracted the WFMT Radio network (formerly part of WFMT-FM), to publish the recordings online. The bulk of the tapes are not yet digitized, but the archive plans to digitize and distribute as many as possible online. The American public radio network NPR is featuring many of the tapes during the week of September 25 - October 2, 2016. The Chicago History Museum is also working with the Library of Congress to make the tapes available online and to visitors to their buildings in Washington, DC.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abThe Good War | \"The Good War\": An Oral History of World War II (1984) is a telling of the oral history of World War II written by Studs Terkel.

The title refers to the latter\\'s wish that her \"favourite\" son, although already rather old for following his alleged vocation, become a clergyman. It was said that it was John Braine\\'s personal favourite novel of all those that he wrote and was finally filmed in 2005.\u00bb\\n[6] \u00abRoom at the Top (novel) | Room at the Top is a novel by John Braine, first published in the United Kingdom by Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1957, about the rise of an ambitious young man of humble origin, and the socio-economic struggles undergone in realising his social ambitions in post-war Britain.
