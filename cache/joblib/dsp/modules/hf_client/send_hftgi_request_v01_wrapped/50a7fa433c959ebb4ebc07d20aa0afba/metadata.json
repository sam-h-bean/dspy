In 1929 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Novel/Literature, for her novel \"Scarlet Sister Mary.\" She wrote several novels about the plantation South, especially the Gullah people of the Low Country.

L. Doctorow or Julia Peterkin?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to determine who has a broader scope of profession. We can see that E. L. Doctorow is a novelist, and Julia Peterkin is also a novelist. However, Julia Peterkin has a broader scope of profession because she is not only a novelist, but also a Pulitzer Prize winner, and she wrote several novels about the plantation South, especially the Gullah people of the Low Country. Additionally, she was one of the few white authors who wrote about the African-American experience. On the other hand, E. L. Doctorow is only a novelist and does not have any awards or recognition for his work. Therefore, Julia Peterkin has a broader scope of profession.\\n\\nAnswer:', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 75, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ['\\n', '\\n\\n']}}}"}, "time": 1697828112.4361098}
