Set in the early 1960s among the Irish Catholic community in a small Yorkshire town, the book is about a 30-year-old mummy\\'s boy and his attempts at liberating himself from his domineering mother. The title refers to the latter\\'s wish that her \"favourite\" son, although already rather old for following his alleged vocation, become a clergyman. It was said that it was John Braine\\'s personal favourite novel of all those that he wrote and was finally filmed in 2005.\u00bb\\n[6] \u00abRoom at the Top (novel) | Room at the Top is a novel by John Braine, first published in the United Kingdom by Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1957, about the rise of an ambitious young man of humble origin, and the socio-economic struggles undergone in realising his social ambitions in post-war Britain.

We know that John Braine is an English novelist, so we can start by looking for information about his nationality. According to the text, John Braine is English. On the other hand, Studs Terkel is an American author, historian, actor, and broadcaster, so he is not English. Therefore, the answer is John Braine.\\n\\nAnswer: John Braine\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] \u00abLong Island serial killer | Long Island serial killer (also referred to by media sources as the Gilgo Beach Killer or the Craigslist Ripper) is an unidentified suspected serial killer who is believed to have murdered 10 to 16 people associated with prostitution, over a period of nearly 20 years, and dumped their bodies along the Ocean Parkway, near the remote Long Island, New York beach towns of Gilgo Beach and Oak Beach in Suffolk County, and the area of Jones Beach State Park in Nassau County.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abThe Long Island Serial Killer (film) | The Long Island Serial Killer (also known as The Gilgo Beach Murders) is a 2013 American true crime horror film loosely based on the elusive Long Island serial killer who murdered seventeen women on Long Island between 1996 and 2010.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abGilgo-Oak Beach-Captree, New York | Gilgo-Oak Beach-Captree is a former census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York and the Town of Babylon.

We know that the documentary is about the Gilgo Beach Killer, and it debuted on A&E. We also know that the Long Island Serial Killer case is associated with the Gilgo Beach Killer. Therefore, the documentary must be \"The Killing Season\".\\n\\nAnswer: The Killing Season.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContext:\\n[1] \u00abSan Francisco mayoral election, 1975 | The 1975 mayoral election was held to select the 37th mayor of San Francisco, and was held in two parts.
