In 1929 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Novel/Literature, for her novel \"Scarlet Sister Mary.\" She wrote several novels about the plantation South, especially the Gullah people of the Low Country. She was one of the few white authors who wrote about the African-American experience.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abJulia Polak | Dr Dame Julia Margaret Polak, DBE, FMedSci (26 June 1939 \u2013 11 August 2014) was an Argentine-born British pathologist. She was head of the Centre for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine at Imperial College London, a centre for medical research she set up with Larry Hench, also from Imperial College, to develop cells and tissues for transplantation into humans.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abJulia Catherine Stimson | Julia Catherine Stimson {\\'1\\': \", \\'2\\': \", \\'3\\': \", \\'4\\': \"} (May 26, 1881 \u2013 September 30, 1948) was an American nurse, credited as one of several persons who brought nursing to the status of a profession.\u00bb\\n[4] \u00abScarlet Sister Mary | Scarlet Sister Mary is a 1928 novel by Julia Peterkin. It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1929. The book was called obscene and banned at the public library in Gaffney, South Carolina. \"The Gaffney Ledger\" newspaper, however, serially published the complete book. Dr. Richard S. Burton, the chairperson of Pulitzer\\'s fiction-literature jury, recommended that the first prize go to the novel \"Victim and Victor\" by John Rathbone Oliver. His nomination was superseded by the School of Journalism\\'s choice of Peterkin\\'s book. Evidently in protest, Burton resigned from the jury.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abJohn Rathbone Oliver | John Rathbone Oliver (January 4, 1872 \u2013 January 21, 1943) was an American psychiatrist, medical historian, author, and priest. His novel \"Victim and Victor\" was a contender for the 1929 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, but was beat out by Julia Peterkin\\'s \"Scarlet Sister Mary\".\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: Who has a broader scope of profession: E. L. Doctorow or Julia Peterkin?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to answer this question. We know that both authors have written novels, but Julia Peterkin has also been a nurse and a pioneer in the field of nursing, while E. L. Doctorow has not been a nurse. Therefore, Julia Peterkin has a broader scope of profession than E. L. Doctorow.\\n\\nAnswer:', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 75, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ['\\n', '\\n\\n']}}}"}, "time": 1697828130.142154}
